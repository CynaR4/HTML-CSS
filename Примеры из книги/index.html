<h1> Bunnie Poems </h1>
<h2 class="display-3"> The Bunnie Who Had No Ears </h2>
<p> The following is a mostly unintelligent poem about Bunnies. Don't think too hard about them.
 <br /> Enjoy!
</p><h2> The Bunnie Who Had No Ears </h2><p> Mr Bunnie. How big the ears of your ancestors </p>
<p class="text-info">How fluffy the pride of your family </p>
<p class="display-2">But, wait... </p>
<p class="text-justify">How is it that you have no ears </p>
<p> With your eyes you hear, and your nose you see? </p>
<p> How sad, Mr Bunny </p>
<p> See him hop, hop, hop about on legs so very strong.</p>
<p> But ears, he has none <p>
<p class="text-lowercase">Live long, and make your ancestors proud </p>
